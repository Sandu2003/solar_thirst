        <h2>Installation Process and Payment Flow</h2>
        <p>Here is a detailed breakdown of how the installation process and payment system works:</p>
        
        <section class="step">
            <h3>Step 1: Request Service</h3>
            <p>Once you fill out the service request form, our team will evaluate your needs and recommend the most suitable installation plan based on your requirements.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
            <h3>Step 2: Quotation</h3>
            <p>After your service request is reviewed, you will receive a customized quotation. The quotation will include details of the installation plan, costs, and any additional services that might be required.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
            <h3>Step 3: Confirmation</h3>
            <p>Once you approve the quotation, our team will confirm the schedule for installation. You will also be informed of the necessary documents required (e.g., payment confirmation, ID card copy, etc.).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
            <h3>Step 4: Payment Process</h3>
            <p>We offer flexible payment options. You can either pay the full amount upfront or opt for installment plans. Youâ€™ll receive a payment receipt once the transaction is completed. If you choose an installment plan, your monthly payments will be automatically deducted based on the agreed schedule.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
            <h3>Step 5: Installation</h3>
            <p>Once the payment is processed, we will schedule a date for installation. Our qualified technicians will arrive on-site and install the solar system. Youâ€™ll receive a confirmation once the installation is complete.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
            <h3>Step 6: Final Verification & Handover</h3>
            <p>After installation, we will conduct a final verification to ensure everything is working as expected. Once verified, the system will be handed over to you, and you can begin using it right away.</p>
